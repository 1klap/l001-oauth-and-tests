# README

This is a companion project for [this article](https://railsguru.dev/lessons/rails-8-oauth-and-rspec-tests)

## TL;DR

Rails 8 ships with a new built-in generator that helps you to get started with authentication. However, while it covers 
the bases, often something more is needed. OAuth Sign In reduces friction for the user and removes (to a degree) the 
burden of password management. Better test coverage helps with developer productivity and product reliability.

The goal of this lesson is to make those steps as easy as possible.
